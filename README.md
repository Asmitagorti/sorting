Sorting Algorithms in C 🧮🚀
This repository give an understanding of various sorting algorithms in C. 

📌 What's Inside?

🫧 Bubble Sort – Slow but steady, like a bubbling pot of water.
🏆 Selection Sort – Picks the best, one step at a time.
🏗️ Insertion Sort – Builds the sorted list brick by brick.
✂️ Merge Sort – Divide, conquer, and rule!
⚡ Quick Sort – The speed demon of sorting!

🎩 Non-Comparison Sorting (Where sorting happens like magic ✨)

📊 Radix Sort – Sorting from the digits up!
🪣 Bucket Sort – Sorting by throwing numbers into buckets.
🤔 Why Sorting?
Sorting is not just about arranging numbers—it's the foundation of many computer science concepts, from searching to optimizing algorithms. Whether you're preparing for coding interviews or just love algorithmic challenges, these implementations will sharpen your skills.
